              <div class="text">The history of Montr&eacute;al, located in Qu&eacute;bec, Canada, spans about 8,000 years. At the time of European contact, the area was inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, a discrete and distinct group of Iroquoian-speaking indigenous people. Jacques Cartier became the first European to reach the area now known as Montr&eacute;al in 1535 when he entered the village of Hochelaga on the Island of Montr&eacute;al while in search of a passage to Asia during the Age of Exploration. Seventy years later, Samuel de Champlain unsuccessfully tried to create a fur trading post but the Mohawk of the Iroquois defended what they had been using as their hunting grounds.

             <div class="text">The architecture of Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec, Canada is characterized by the juxtaposition of the old and the new and a wide variety of architectural styles, the legacy of two successive colonizations by the French, the British, and the close presence of modern architecture to the south. Much like Quebec City, the city of Montr&eacute;al had fortifications, but they were destroyed between 1804 and 1817.
